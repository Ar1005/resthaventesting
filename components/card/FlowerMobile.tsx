            Rest Haven Memorial Park is honored to introduce our Floral
            Placement Program â€“ a cherished and reliable way to commemorate your
            beloved departed ones with exquisitely crafted artificial floral
            arrangements thoughtfully arranged throughout the year.

            This program caters to bronze or granite vases affixed to markers or
            monuments, as well as mausoleum crypts. Choose from one, two, or
            three seasonal bouquets, to be delicately placed during the first
            month of each season. Alternatively, for significant milestones,
            select a specific date, and pick the perfect bouquet for that
            special occasion.
